# teg_Hopfield
Binary and continuous Hopfield networks

The file teg_Hopfield contains classes for binary and continuous Hopfield networks (https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers). See script0.py for an example of the use of the code in the study reported in the manuscript "Continuous Hopfield dynamics of semantic vector-based activation patterns predict variations of priming effects over items" (https://psyarxiv.com/wbrmj).
